## Installation

### Installation with CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. See the [Get Started](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) section for more details.

#### Podfile
```
platform :ios, '9.0'
pod 'Applio'
```

##### Swift and static framework

Swift project previously had to use `use_frameworks!` to make all Pods into dynamic framework to let CocoaPods work.

However, starting with `CocoaPods 1.5.0+` (with `Xcode 9+`), which supports to build both Objective-C && Swift code into static framework. You can use modular headers to use SDWebImage as static framework, without the need of `use_frameworks!`:

```
platform :ios, '9.0'
# Uncomment the next line when you want all Pods as static framework
# use_modular_headers!
pod 'Applio'
```

See more on [CocoaPods 1.5.0 â€” Swift Static Libraries](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-1.5.0/)

If not, you still need to add `use_frameworks!` to use SDWebImage as dynamic framework:

```
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!
pod 'Applio'
```

### Build Project

At this point your workspace should build without error. If you are having problem, post to the Issue and the
